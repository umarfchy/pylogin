# pylogin
A simple login script made using python. It contains a check point to see if a single user is trying to register multiple times. Also, a simple hashing algorith was implemented using 'hasblib' to hash the passwords provided by the users. It saves the user data as a dictionary object and stores it using 'pickle' module.
